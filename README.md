# LeetCode Solutions
This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems, solved in Python and Java by (me) [maddox05](https://github.com/maddox05).

## Motivation
The purpose of this repository is to provide a resource for individuals who are preparing for technical interviews and coding challenges. LeetCode is a popular platform for practicing coding challenges and improving problem-solving skills. By providing solutions to a variety of problems, this repository aims to help individuals gain a better understanding of different algorithms and data structures and how they can be applied to solve problems.

## Contents
The solutions are organized by problem and by what language they are done in.

## Usage
Feel free to use these solutions as a resource for your own preparation for coding interviews and challenges. However, it is important to keep in mind that simply memorizing solutions is not enough to succeed in technical interviews. It is important to understand the underlying concepts and be able to apply them to different problems.

## Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have a solution to a LeetCode problem that I have already solved and you see any way to make it better (i'm sure there is) feel free to start a pull request.
